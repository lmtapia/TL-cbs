#4 Statements

Syntax 
Stmt: stmt ::= id '=' aexp
             | 'print' exp
             | 'if' bexp block 'else' block
             | block
             
Block : block ::= '{' stmt* '}'          


Semantics 
  execute[[ _:stmt* ]] : =>null-type 

Rule 
  execute[[ ID '=' AExp ]] = assign(bound(id[[ ID ]]), eval[[ AExp ]])
Rule
  execute[['print' Exp ]] =
    print ( to-string eval[[Exp]], "\n" )
Rule
  execute[['if' BExp Block1 'else' Block2]] = 
    if-else(eval-bool[[BExp]], execute[[Block1]], execute[[Block2]])    
Rule
  execute[[ '{' Stmt* '}' ]] = execute[[ Stmt* ]]
Rule
  execute[[ ]] = null-value

Rule
  execute[[Stmt Stmt+]] = sequential( execute[[Stmt]], execute[[Stmt+]] )
